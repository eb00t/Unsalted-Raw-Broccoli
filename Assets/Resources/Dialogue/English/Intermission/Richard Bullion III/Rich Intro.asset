  - Hoho! Another neophyte!
  - Pleasure to meet you! Richard Bullion the Third, at your service!
  - 'You''re looking like quite the scrapper! Ready to go! '
  - I arrived at this structure not long before you. Quite the charming place, is

  - Those from many walks of life populate these walls, many even older than myself.
  - Though that may not be such an impressive feat, hoho!
  - ... *ahem*
  - Well then, I wish you the best of luck! Make sure you show this automaton what
    for, eh?
