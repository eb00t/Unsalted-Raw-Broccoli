  - Wait.
  - That face of yours...You're new.
  - Some advice. I don't know how strong you were back wherever you came from,
  - But this is nothing like you've experienced before.
  - Name's Specto. I gave up on searching for the treasure here years ago.
  - I've seen hundreds, no, thousands of people walk through that door.
  - The amount of people I've seen come back? Number has two digits.
  - Luckily for you, the people around here have been working on something. Think
    of it as a sort of practice...
  - Some low stakes training to help you get a taste of what you'll be up against.
  - Door's in the center room if you're interested. If not, have fun dying, I guess.
