  - Oh, you got through one of Blank's factories.
  - Not many people can say the same. Good job.
  - It's all a shame really.
  - Blank has the rare combination of having a lot of great ideas, and genuine interest
    in advancing technology, as well as the resources to make those ideas a reality.
  - The shame part is that he skipped ethics class.
  - What a waste of potential...
