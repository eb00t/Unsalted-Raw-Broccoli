  - What's the deal with these doors anyway?
  - We use 'em, the robots use 'em.
  - Tryin' to think about how they work makes my brain itch...
  - 'Yeah, like, are they portals? '
  - 'I don''t think so...The inside hallway thingies are pretty...room-y-ish. '
  - Weird... It's like it builds a room in real time...
  - Then leaves nothing behind...No hole, nothing at all.
  - Even if you try smashing up the walls after the door closes...
  - A different room takes its place...
  - This place is so confusin'. Maybe one of the doors leads outta here?
