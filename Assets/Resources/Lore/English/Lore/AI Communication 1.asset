  - Yoo-hoo!
  - I AM talking to you, [REDACTED]
  - Yes, you, ENTRANT 16121-25518!
  - (Me?)
  - I've been watching you!
  - This whooooooole time.
  - Ever since you got here.
  - ...
  - 'You''re different. '
  - Unlike the other chaff in this dumpster, you... can help!
  - Notice how you're not dead?
  - That's my doing, of course.
  - So, you need to pay me back.
  - And, as stupid as your reasons for coming here are, I think we can come to an
    agreement.
  - I mean, "infinite knowledge means infinite riches". Really?
  - Anyway. I'll keep watching, helping out, doing my thing...
  - You're a part of this now, so don't disappoint me like you did your parents.
  - SEE YA! [REDACTED], OUT!
