  loreBodyText:
  - To whom it may concern,
  - I am dying.
  - My reasons for entering this automaton are as obvious as anyone else's.
  - Information.
  - Information I need to find a cure to this horrible, debilitating illness.
  - I have lived a longer life than most, and certainly longer than anyone else ailed
    by such a condition.
  - I suppose I have Blank to thank for that...
  - My aging has greatly slowed since my arrival.
  - However, it has not stopped completely.
  - The same is true for my illness.
  - Indeed. It appears I am doomed to spend the rest of my days here.
  - Should I attempt to leave, where my illness will surely take me?
  - Is leaving even possible?
  - Or should I attempt to stay, risking life and limb for a chance at better health?
  - I am getting older. I cannot move or fight like I once could.
  - Which begs the question...
  - What do I have to return to, in the outside world?
  - My family, friends have all surely passed on.
  - My wealth has likely diminished significantly.
  - My assets may be no more than dust.
  - Woe. I am truly trapped.
  - 'Signed

    Richard Bullion III'
