  - '*ahem*'
  - I-I'm not sure what happened yesterday...was it even yesterday?
  - I remember that robot slashing me...then everything went black...
  - When I woke up, there wasn't even a scar...My clothes...they were pristine...like
    the first day I arrived...
  - ...
  - I was thinking, maybe I've been hallucinating this whole thing...Maybe I didn't
    get slashed after all...
  - It could have been a dream, yeah...
  - But...
  - 'In that case...how long have I been dreaming for...? '
  - This isn't where I got attacked...In fact...I don't recognize this place at all...
  - Ugh...
  - My head hurts just thinking about all this...I'm going to try and find somewhere...somewhere
    safe...
  - S-signing off now...
