  - Hello, there, well done for finding your way into this complex, it is not easy
    task!
  - You're proably wondering who I am, what's going on, where exactly you are?
  - Truth be told, I cannot answer all your questions but I do have some information
    that may be of use.
  - I am an old friend of the man who created this place,
  - the man who calls himself Dr. Blank, although that is not how I knew him.
  - Dr. Blank, my friend, used to be a great man and an even better scientist!
  - He created many things to help better our world,
  - but he was determined to discover a way to make interdimensional travel possible.
  - His research was shut down, and his work confiscated right before he could showcase
    his lateest 'breakthrough'.
  - This drove him to madness and he set off to prove his worth and get his revenge,
  - and so 'The Construct' was built.
  - Dr. Blank has committed many attrocities within these was all in the name of
    'science'.
  - Even so I do believe that the man I once called a friend, a brother, may still
    be in there somehow.
  - But this has gone too far, many have perished trying to put an end to this but
    perhaps you are different.
  - Find him and set things right, reason with him if you can, although I fear he
    is too far gone.
