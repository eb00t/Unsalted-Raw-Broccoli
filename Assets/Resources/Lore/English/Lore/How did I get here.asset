  loreBodyText:
  - '*Low humming noise*'
  - What is that sound, I've heard it somewhere before!
  - '*Humming continues, growing slightly louder*'
  - Ah, I remember now, that's the last thing  I heard before I ended up here!
  - That's the noise that led me to that portal looking thing!
  - Maybe, I should have just stayed away, those people weren't lying when they said
    this place was dangerous.
  - I'm beginning to think I may not make it out of here myself!
