  loreBodyText:
  - There are tons of strange creatures that roam these halls.
  - Chances are you've already encountered some of them already, like the fellas
    that look like they've got knives for hands.
  - Slow moving but they sure do pack a punch!
  - Hitting them from behind is a sure-fire way to take them by suprise and avoid
    that damage!
