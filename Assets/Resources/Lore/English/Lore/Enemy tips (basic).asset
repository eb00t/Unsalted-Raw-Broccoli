  loreBodyText:
  - There are a lot of strange machines that roam these halls.
  - Chances are you've already encountered some of them already, like the fellas
    with knives for hands.
  - Slow moving but they sure do pack a punch!
  - Hitting them from behind is a sure-fire way to take them by surprise and avoid
    getting a haircut nine inches too low.
  - Or just whale on them till their guard breaks...
  - Oh, and the red ones can turn invisible too... Watch out for that...
  - You're welcome, heh heh...
