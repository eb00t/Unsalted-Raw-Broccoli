  loreBodyText:
  - Hey there to whomever it may concern!
  - If survived long enough to be reading this then well done!
  - I've been here for what feels like weeks but I think it may have only been a
    few hours, time loses all meaning here.
  - Welcome to The Construct and congratulations on sealing your fate, no one makes
    it out of here alive.
  - I wish I had listened to what I was told, but the thoughts of the 'riches untold'
    that this place held was enough for me to ignore the warnings.
  - I left behind everything, my best friend is probably out there right now wondering
    where I went,
  - all because of some stupid dream, to make a better life for us.
  - This place is not like the stories, it's worse, no one enters here and lives
    to tell the tale, I wish I'd listened before.
  - If anyone ever sees this just know you are doomed, and if this ever makes it
    to my friend,
  - you know who you are, I'm so sorry, I should've lsitened to you when I had the
    chance.
  - (Is that who I think it is? They were right here...)
