  - Hello?
  - Is this thing on?
  - Right ok, *clears throat*.
  - If you're hearing this then that means I'm dead.
  - Well probably...
  - Did that sound cool? I've always wanted to say that!
  - Anyway, I think I've found something much bigger and more formidable than any
    iof the other freaks in this place.
  - I swear I could hear it through the walls, this mechanical whirring, I just didn't
    know what it was.
  - Some kind of robot monster, I fear.
  - A creature like that has to be guarding something important right?
  - This must be it, treasure, a way out, both!
  - I'll record my findings on the other side, wish me luck!
  - (Something tells me that they never got the chance to record anything else!)
