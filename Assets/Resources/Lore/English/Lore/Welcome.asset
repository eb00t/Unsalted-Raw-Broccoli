  loreBodyText:
  - I know what you're thinking, what's a file dump?
  - It's a basically like a storage place for any loose files you may come across
    on your travels.
  - So, if you wanna read stuff you came across again (or for the first time...),
    here's your spot for it.
  - I also loaded it with your Entry Number, so you can see exactly how many times
    you've done certain things!
  - You're welcome, by the way.
