  - '*ahem*'
  - I swear I saw that exact robot yesterday.
  - I literally smashed it to bits.
  - But...
  - Now it's back.
  - I know what you're thinking...
  - '"It was obviously just repaired, you idiot. Robots can be fixed."'
  - But...
  - It...recognised me.
  - I'm sure of it.
  - I looked it dead in its stupid robot eyes and it stared right back.
  - I SWEAR! I'M NOT GOING CRAZY!
  - THE ROBOTS HERE ARE COMING BACK TO LIFE!
  - ...
  - Uh...maybe...?
  - This place hurts my head.
  - S-signing off now...
