  - Hello child, you are new here, you are different from the others.
  - I have forseen the arrival of someone like you, determined, cunning, vengeful.
  - 'Tell me, what have you come here for, riches, fame, got a point to prove? '
  - Ah, I can see it now, a lost soul in your past, a friend perhaps?
  - They have been lost to The Construct and yet you have come to find them!
  - Ha, ha!
  - If you think they are still alive then you are more of a fool than I thought.
  - Good luck with your search, child, you will need all the luck you can get in
    here!
